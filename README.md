# dog-breeds
A statistical study of the relationship between the mass of dog breeds and their life expectancy.
This sample of 72 dog breeds helped me conduct a modest study on the relationship between average life expectancy and average mass in pounds of major dog breeds.
The result, as showcased in the png file is a statistically significant (p-value < 0.000) negative relationship between mass and life expectancy.
