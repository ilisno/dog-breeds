# dog-breeds
A statistical (linear regression) study of the relationship between the **mass of dog breeds** and their **life expectancy**  
This sample of 72 dog breeds helped me conduct a modest study on the relationship between average life expectancy and average mass in pounds of major dog breeds.  
The result is a statistically significant (p-value < 0.000) **negative relationship between mass and life expectancy**.
